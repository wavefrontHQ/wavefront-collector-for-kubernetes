      Hi! Thank you for coming to our channel! In order to help you get the most efficient answer to your question, could you please answer the questions below? ðŸ˜ƒ
      
      1. What version of the collector and proxy are running?
      1. What is your deployment environment? (K8s version, cloud, self-hosted, managed, unmanaged)
      1. How did you install the collector and proxy (TMC, Helm, Operator, Manual)
      1. What kind of environment is this? (internal customer environment, external customer, POC, demo, lab, dev, test, production, etc.)
      1. Is it a bug?
      1. Please provide a shortlink to the appropriate chart/dashboard/customer tenant
      1. If its a customer environment, what is the customer or prospect, and is it blocking a sales opportunity?
      1. For questions related to configuration, can you please run
          `kubectl get configmap/wavefront-collector-config -n wavefront -o yaml`
         to get the collector config?
      1. What steps from the troubleshooting guide have you tried? What were the results?
      1. How is what is happening different that what were you expecting to see?
      1. Does the troubleshooting dashboard show that your collector is healthy?
      1. Lastly, could you please go download and run the following script and upload the zip file it creates (k8s-assist-info.zip)? This will help us pinpoint which component of ours is causing the issue.
